These metrics, along with each city's population, have been compiled into a final table for easy comparison and analysis.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","*   **Infrastructure Metrics Compilation:** An empty list, `all_cities_metrics`, was initialized to store the calculated infrastructure metrics.\n","*   **Kigali:** The city of Kigali, with a population of 1,959,600, exhibited a road density of approximately 0.81 km/km² and 10.72 health facilities per 100,000 people.\n","*   **Nairobi:** Nairobi's infrastructure metrics were calculated after successfully loading its geospatial data. The city has a road density of approximately 1.05 km/km² and 11.30 health facilities per 100,000 people.\n","*   **Kampala:** For Kampala, the road density was found to be approximately 2.26 km/km², and there are about 40.12 health facilities per 100,000 people.\n","*   **Dar es Salaam:** Dar es Salaam shows a road density of approximately 0.62 km/km² and 4.68 health facilities per 100,000 people.\n","*   **Rabat:** Rabat has the highest road density among the analyzed cities, at approximately 3.14 km/km², and about 5.57 health facilities per 100,000 people.\n","*   **Casablanca:** Casablanca has a road density of approximately 1.77 km/km² and the lowest health facility density among the analyzed cities, with about 1.83 facilities per 100,000 people.\n","*   **Final Data Table:** All calculated metrics were successfully integrated into a pandas DataFrame named `df_city_metrics`, providing a comprehensive and structured overview of population, road density, and health facility density for all six cities.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The wide variation in both road and health facility densities across these cities (e.g., Rabat's road density at 3.14 km/km² vs. Dar es Salaam's at 0.62 km/km², or Kampala's health density at 40.12 per 100k vs. Casablanca's at 1.83 per 100k) suggests different stages of urban development or planning priorities that warrant further investigation.\n","*   Future analysis could involve normalizing these densities by economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita) or urban planning indices to understand the efficiency and equity of infrastructure provision relative to each city's context.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Normalize"],"metadata":{"id":"qpzO2Wr7ew3z"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import

Dar es Salaam, with a raw value of 0.000000, has a normalized value of 1.000000, while Nairobi, with a raw value of 1.000000, has a normalized value of 0.000000.\n","*   The creation of this column ensures consistency with other normalized and inverted metrics within the DataFrame, which is crucial for comparative analysis where a higher value indicates a more desirable characteristic.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The `open_space_per_100k_pop_norm` column is now standardized and aligned with other inverted metrics, making it ready for direct inclusion in multi-criteria decision analysis or composite scoring, where a higher score signifies better performance.\n","*   The dataset is now more coherent, allowing for straightforward aggregation and comparison of city attributes that have been transformed to a common scale and direction.\n"]}]}
